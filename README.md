# CMT307
Coursework Project

A machine learning project to build a binary classification model for sentiment analysis of movie ratings data.

This project contains the following files and directories: datasets (directories), IMDbAnalyse.py, README.txt.

System Requirements
This python script requires a python environment running at least python 3.6. 
Numpy, SKLearn and NLTK are dependent packages, and internet access is required to download some components of NLTK. 
For example, execution in an ipython environment would require the command "%run IMDbAnalyse.py". 
The IMDbAnalyse.py file should be located in the same directory as the accompanying datasets directory.

Overview
The 'datasets' directory contains the positive and negative .txt files for training, development and test sets. 
Further documentation about the datasets can be found in the README.txt file in the IMDb directory.

'IMDbAnalyse.py' is a python scrpit which uses the accompanying IMDb dataset to perform sentiment analysis using an SVM binary Classifier.
